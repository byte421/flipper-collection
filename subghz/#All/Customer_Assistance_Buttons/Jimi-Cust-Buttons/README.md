# Customer Assistance Buttons Research

This repository houses the work that ive put into reversing the various encoders and protocols used for customer service buttons in retail shops such as Walgreens, CVS, Lowes, and Home Depot

Each retailer is broken out into it's own folder, and within that folder are the CU8 sdr signals as well as a folder for the FlipperZero subghz sub captures.

Please clone this repository or include it as a submodule in your repository if you link to it. Please do not simply copy the work here into your own repository, as it does not allow Github and the community to accurately track the metrics. It also makes it more difficult for you to integrate the latest changes.
